# Contribution guidelines

Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!

If you want an item to be added to the list, it must:

1. Be awesome. You should be able to reason about why it is awesome.
2. Be relevant to ComputerCraft. It could be an awesome ComputerCraft extension mod, or an awesome tutorial. It cannot be your friend's cat's Facebook page, or your irrelevant project.
3. Can immediately used. It has to have an installation script, or (in the case of literature) immediately read.

## PRs

Added items should be in alphabetical order, with some exceptions:
- The ComputerCraft Mods subsection is sorted manually, to keep the modern mods on top and the legacy mods at the bottom.
- The Resources section is sorted manually, from preferred resources to avoided resources.

Commit messages should be written like this:

```
Add <item> and <item>
Add <section>
Fix [typo|dead link|<error type>]
```

With few to no exceptions.
