# Contribution guidelines

Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!

If you want an item to be added to the list, it must:

1. Be awesome. You should be able to explain why it is awesome.
2. Be relevant to ComputerCraft. It could be an awesome ComputerCraft extension mod, or an awesome tutorial. It cannot be your friend's cat's Facebook page, or your irrelevant project.
3. Can immediately used. It has to have an installation script, or (in the case of literature) immediately read.

## PRs

Commit messages should be written like this:

```
Add <item> and <item>
Add <section>
Fix [typo|dead link|<error type>]
```

With few to no exceptions.
